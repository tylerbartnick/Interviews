# About This Repository

This repository is a place for me to put various small projects/solutions to common programming problems that often come up in interviews.
Feel free to e-mail me about any questions regarding the content found here.

### Repository Information

This repository is broken up into 3 main categories at this time:

    - `src` which is comprised of Java source files and JUnit tests for said Java source files
    - `daily-programmer` which is a collection of my solutions to the /r/dailyprogrammer prompts
    - `web-programming` which is a collection of small web projects and PoCs to demonstrate basic knowledge of various technologies

### Executable JAR Files

I have provided executable JAR files for everything under the `com.tylerbartnick.utilities` package. They can be found under the releases tab.

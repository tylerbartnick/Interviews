### Programmer's Note
My solutions vary in complexity and scale proportionately with the challenge itself. Thus, not all solutions will have object-oriented designs and may just be simple scripts or programs. Additionally, I do my best to follow best practices and language/industry standards for all solutions, even when the challenges are simple in nature. However, there may be some exceptions to this rule in the interest of brevity.

Please enjoy reading through my solutions.

Happy coding!
